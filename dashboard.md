## Ticket Handling Methodology

This project simulates a real-world IT Help Desk workflow.  
All support tickets were prioritized and resolved based on business impact and urgency:

- 🔴 **High Priority**: Security breaches, login issues, BSOD, VPN — addressed immediately.
- 🟡 **Medium Priority**: Slow network, hardware damage — scheduled after critical issues.
- 🟢 **Low Priority**: Software requests, non-urgent tasks — resolved when possible.

Each ticket was reviewed and resolved independently, following realistic troubleshooting procedures.

For ticket details, view each linked `README.md` file from the [Ticket Dashboard](#-it-help-desk-ticket-dashboard).
