## Issue Description

> _Sarah reported that she had no sound on her laptop. The speaker icon in the system tray showed a “X,” and hovering over it displayed the message: **"The Audio Service is not running."** This issue began after she force-shutdown the laptop while it was frozen._

---

## Initial Diagnosis

- Checked **Device Manager** → Audio drivers appeared installed but inactive.
- Verified that the **Windows Audio** service was stopped.
- Suspected cause: Service crash or failure to start after improper shutdown.

---

## Steps Taken to Resolve

### Step 1 — Check Audio Settings

- Right-clicked the sound icon → Selected **Troubleshoot sound problems**.
- Confirmed the troubleshooter detected “Audio service not running.”

---

### Step 2 — Start Audio Services Manually

- Pressed **Windows + R** → typed:

```
services.msc
```

- Located:
  - **Windows Audio**
- Set both to **Automatic (Delayed Start)** → Clicked **Start**.

---

### Step 3 — Restart Windows Audio from Command Prompt

- Opened **Command Prompt as Administrator** → ran:

```cmd
net stop audiosrv
net start audiosrv
```

- Ensured no error messages were returned.

---

### Step 4 — Test Sound Output

- Played a test sound via:
  - Control Panel → Sound → Playback → Speakers → Configure → Test
- Audio playback worked normally.

---

## Final Resolution

> _Restarting the Windows Audio services restored sound functionality. The issue was caused by the services failing to start after an improper shutdown._
