## Issue Description

> Multiple employees reported receiving a suspicious email asking them to click a link and provide login credentials.  
> The link appeared to lead to a fake corporate login page.

---

## Initial Diagnosis

Reviewed the reported emails and confirmed they were phishing attempts.  
Observed mismatched sender addresses, generic greetings, urgent language, and a non-corporate domain in the embedded link.  
Verified through the company’s phishing reporting tool that the domain was not previously flagged.

---

## Steps Taken to Resolve

1. **Instructed all recipients** not to click the link or enter any credentials.
2. **Collected full email headers** from affected employees for further analysis.
3. **Analyzed the URL** using VirusTotal and confirmed it was a known phishing site.
4. **Blocked the sender domain and IP** at the email gateway.
5. **Added the malicious URL** to the corporate web filter blacklist.
6. **Force-reset passwords** for any employees who had already clicked the link and submitted credentials.
7. **Submitted the phishing report** to the company’s security team and relevant authorities.

## Final Resolution

> The phishing campaign was successfully blocked at the email gateway and web filter.  
> Potentially compromised accounts were secured via immediate password resets.  
> Employees were informed about identifying and reporting similar threats in the future.

## Notes / Recommendations

- Conduct a **company-wide phishing awareness refresher**.
- Encourage employees to verify suspicious links by hovering before clicking.
- Periodically run **phishing simulation tests** to maintain vigilance.
