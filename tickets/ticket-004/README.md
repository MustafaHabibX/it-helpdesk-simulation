## Issue Description

> Sarah reports that when she logged into her Windows 10 workstation this morning, her desktop appeared completely blank. She could still open the Start Menu and run programs, but all desktop icons and the taskbar wallpaper were missing.

---

## Initial Diagnosis

- Confirmed the PC booted normally and no files were missing from **C:\Users\Sarah\Desktop**.
- Suspected that desktop icons were simply hidden or that Windows Explorer had not fully loaded.

---

## Steps Taken to Resolve

1. Right-clicked the desktop and checked **View → Show desktop icons** — it was unchecked.
2. Re-enabled **Show desktop icons**; icons reappeared instantly.
3. As a precaution, pressed `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open **Task Manager**.
4. Restarted the **Windows Explorer** process to ensure taskbar and icons refreshed correctly.
5. Verified all files were present and shortcuts were functional.

---

## Final Resolution

> Enabled “Show desktop icons” in the View menu and restarted Windows Explorer, restoring normal desktop display.

---

## Notes / Recommendations

Advised the user not to accidentally toggle **View → Show desktop icons** while right-clicking the desktop. If the issue reoccurs without user action, check for corrupted Explorer settings or malware.
