## About Me, This Project & The Knowledge Applied

This project is part of my **CompTIA A+ Certification portfolio** — designed to demonstrate real-world IT support expertise and professional documentation skills.

By applying knowledge from multiple **CompTIA A+ domains**, I successfully created and executed this **IT Helpdesk Simulation**, diagnosing and resolving realistic technical issues in a structured and methodical way.  
This project drew on competencies across these technical areas:

---

<details>
<summary><strong>1. Hardware</strong></summary>

- **Peripheral Installation & Configuration:** Setup and troubleshooting of printers, webcams, and display adapters in both physical and virtualized environments.
- **Video Output Troubleshooting:** Diagnosing HDMI and USB-C to HDMI adapter issues, identifying driver limitations, and resolving virtual machine display compatibility problems.
- **Printer Hardware Setup:** Configuring correct device ports (Standard TCP/IP, LPT, COM, USB Virtual ports) and adjusting hardware parameters.
- **Printer Maintenance & Troubleshooting:** Managing print queues, clearing stuck jobs, handling spooler service failures, and resolving “offline” printer statuses.
- **Virtualization Hardware Configuration:** Allocating CPU, RAM, and enabling virtual machine display/USB passthrough settings.

</details>
